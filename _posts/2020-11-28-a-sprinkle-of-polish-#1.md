### We've added a couple of things:



* **We're making history by saving results from previous versions of FM**

  You'll now be able to browse the history of all tested tactics. So if SI throw another two hotfixes at us and we have to restart the testing process, it's not a big deal because the previous result tables will still be available for you.

  

* **You can now see how many tactics have been tested and when the table was last updated** 

  When you check back on the test results, you'll now have a clear idea of what progress has been made since you last visited. Cool!



* **SEO Improvements**

  We've made some improvements to search engine optimisation. Yeah, boring right...



* **We've stopped time travelling**

  We accidentally did some weird stuff with the date, and it was telling us (and you) that we had actually tested all these tactics in October... Our time machine is broke now unfortunately, so it's back to the future.
