#### Another week, more improvements



* **Recently Tested**

  Tactics that have been tested in the past 24 hours will now have a recently tested indicator on them. Only available on Grid-View.



* **Automated Screenshots**

  It's usually annoying when people upload tactics without a screenshot...right? Not anymore. Whilst our beep boop testing robot is testing tactics, it'll also grab screenshots of the tactic, the results and the test. Woah.



* **Sorting ~~Hat~~ Icons**

  Some wizardry happened and poof, sorting icons are perfect.
